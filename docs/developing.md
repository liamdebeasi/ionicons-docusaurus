## Custom Icons

## Variants

Each app icon in Ionicons has a `filled`, `outline`, and `sharp` variant. These different variants are provided to make your app feel native to a variety of platforms. The filled variant uses the default name without a suffix. Note: Logo icons do not have outline or sharp variants.
